# hugo-kicad-site

A reusable Hugo theme for KiCad hardware project documentation.
Works best with [KiBot](https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot) for automated asset generation (Gerbers, BOM, 3D renders, diffs, and more). The included CI workflow uses KiBot to produce all the artifacts the site displays.

**[Live demo →](https://laenzlinger.github.io/hugo-kicad-site/)** | **[Granit →](https://laenzlinger.github.io/granit/latest/)** (a real-world project using this theme)

## Features

- Multi-page versioned documentation (Read the Docs style)
- Version picker in the nav bar on every page
- Embedded [KiCanvas](https://kicanvas.org/) viewer for interactive schematic/PCB browsing
- 3D render gallery (from KiBot/Blender exports)
- Interactive 3D assembly viewer (STEP/GLB/3MF via [Online3DViewer](https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer))
- Combined release page with downloads, diffs, and GitHub release link
- Fullscreen toggle on all viewers
- Downloads section (Gerbers, BOM, iBOM, schematics)
- Links to GitHub repo, OSHWA certification, fabrication, BOM suppliers
- Built-in full-text search
- Dark/light mode with automatic system detection
- Table of contents on every page
- Extensible with custom markdown pages (assembly guides, design notes, etc.)
- Composable pages via `call-partial` shortcode (embed viewers in any Markdown page)
- Fully configurable via `hugo.yaml` params
- Reusable GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD

## Architecture

Each version (git tag or `latest`) gets its own complete Hugo site:

```
gh-pages/
├── index.html          ← redirect to latest/
├── versions.json       ← version list for the picker
├── latest/             ← full site built from main branch
│   ├── index.html      ← overview
│   ├── board/          ← KiCanvas viewer + 3D renders + design notes
│   ├── release/        ← downloads, diffs, GitHub release link
│   ├── assembly/       ← interactive 3D model viewer
│   └── software/       ← custom content
└── v4.0.0/             ← full site built from tag
    └── ...
```

## Usage

### 1. Add the theme to your KiCad repo

Create a `site/` directory in your hardware repo:

```
my-project/
├── my-project.kicad_sch
├── my-project.kicad_pcb
├── my-project.kibot.yaml
└── site/
    ├── .mise.toml
    ├── hugo.yaml
    └── content/
        ├── _index.md         ← overview (custom markdown)
        ├── board.md          ← type: board
        ├── release.md        ← type: release
        └── my-custom-page.md ← any additional content
```

### 2. Add `.mise.toml`

Pin Hugo and Go versions in `site/.mise.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
hugo = "0.160.1"
go = "1.26"
```

### 3. Configure hugo.yaml

```yaml
module:
  imports:
    - path: github.com/laenzlinger/hugo-kicad-site

params:
  projectName: "My KiCad Project"
  repoURL: "https://github.com/org/repo"
```

See [exampleSite/hugo.yaml](exampleSite/hugo.yaml) for all parameters.

### 4. Add content pages

Built-in page types (set via `type` in front matter):

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `board` | KiCanvas schematic/PCB viewer + 3D render gallery + custom content |
| `release` | Combined release notes, downloads, and schematic/PCB diffs |
| `assembly` | Interactive 3D model viewer (STEP/GLB via [Online3DViewer](https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer)) |
| `kicanvas` | Embedded KiCanvas schematic/PCB viewer (standalone, use `board` instead) |
| `gallery` | 3D render image grid (standalone, use `board` instead) |
| `downloads` | Auto-generated download list (standalone, use `release` instead) |
| `changes` | Release notes + diffs (standalone, use `release` instead) |
| *(default)* | Standard markdown page |

Custom pages are plain markdown — add as many as you need.

### Shortcodes

The `call-partial` shortcode lets you embed theme components directly in Markdown — no custom templates needed:

```markdown
{{< call-partial "kicanvas.html" >}}
{{< call-partial "gallery.html" >}}
{{< call-partial "ibom.html" >}}
```

Available partials:

| Partial | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `kicanvas.html` | Interactive KiCanvas schematic/PCB viewer |
| `gallery.html` | 3D render image grid with lightbox |
| `ibom.html` | Interactive BOM viewer with dark mode sync |

This allows fully custom page composition in pure Markdown. See the [Custom Composition](https://laenzlinger.github.io/hugo-kicad-site/latest/custom-composition/) demo page for a live example.

### 5. Set up CI

See [docs/ci.md](docs/ci.md) for GitHub Actions integration.
